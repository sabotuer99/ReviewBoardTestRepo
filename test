This finally works, whoohoo!

Now lets see if I can get Jenkins working...

Maybe this time...

Now lets see if we can get Jenkins to post to ReviewBoard

Lets see how rbt tools likes these apples

This should automatically publish (rpt post -p)

Now we see the magic happen

maybe this time...

That worked, but maybe this will work better, using --username and --password cli arguments to rbt post

Maybe try this with a meaningful commit message


hopefully this opens a new review (opened a DIFFERENT open review... this requires some more exploration)

Deleted all the open reviews, so we should definitely get a new review this commit.... lol it dug up another draft or something

Let's try this again...
